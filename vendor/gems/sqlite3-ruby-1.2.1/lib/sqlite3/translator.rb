  # The Translator class encapsulates the logic and callbacks necessary for
  # converting string data to a value of some specified type. Every Database
  # instance may have a Translator instance, in order to assist in type
  # translation (Database#type_translation).
  #
  # Further, applications may define their own custom type translation logic
  # by registering translator blocks with the corresponding database's
  # translator instance (Database#translator).

    # translations to the given type. The type should be an SQL datatype, and
    # may include parentheses (i.e., "VARCHAR(30)"). However, any parenthetical
    # information is stripped off and discarded, so type translation decisions
    # are made solely on the "base" type name.
    #
    # The translator block itself should accept two parameters, "type" and
    # "value". In this case, the "type" is the full type name (including
    # parentheses), so the block itself may include logic for changing how a
    # type is translated based on the additional data. The "value" parameter
    # is the (string) data to convert.
