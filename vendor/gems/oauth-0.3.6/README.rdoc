= Ruby OAuth GEM

== What

This is a RubyGem for implementing both OAuth clients and servers in Ruby applications.

See the OAuth specs http://oauth.net/core/1.0/

== Installing

  sudo gem install oauth

You can also install it from the oauth rubyforge project http://rubyforge.org/projects/oauth/.

The source code is now hosted on the OAuth GitHub Project http://github.com/mojodna/oauth

== The basics

This is a ruby library which is intended to be used in creating Ruby Consumer and Service Provider applications. It is NOT a Rails plugin, but could easily be used for the foundation for such a Rails plugin.

As a matter of fact it has been pulled out from an OAuth Rails Plugin http://code.google.com/p/oauth-plugin/ which now requires this GEM.

== Demonstration of usage

Create a new consumer instance by passing it a configuration hash:

  @consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new("key","secret", :site => "https://agree2")

Start the process by requesting a token

  @request_token = @consumer.get_request_token
  session[:request_token] = @request_token
  redirect_to @request_token.authorize_url

When user returns create an access_token

  @access_token = @request_token.get_access_token
  @photos = @access_token.get('/photos.xml')

For more detailed instructions I have written this OAuth Client Tutorial http://stakeventures.com/articles/2008/02/23/developing-oauth-clients-in-ruby and "How to turn your rails site into an OAuth Provider ":http://stakeventures.com/articles/2007/11/26/how-to-turn-your-rails-site-into-an-oauth-provider .

Finally be sure to check out the OAuth RDoc Manual http://oauth.rubyforge.org/rdoc/ .
